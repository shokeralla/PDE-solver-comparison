# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Burgers' Equation

## Performance Metrics

| Method | MSE | Runtime (hours) | Memory (GB) |
|--------|-----|----------------|-------------|
| FEM    | 3.2e-5 | 0.5 | 2.1 |
| HMC    | 1.1e-3 | 4.7 | 8.3 |
| PINN   | 9.61e-02 | 0.06 | 0.78 |

## Analysis

- **Accuracy**: PINNs achieved lower accuracy compared to both FEM and HMC.
- **Runtime**: PINNs were faster than both FEM and HMC.
- **Memory Usage**: PINNs used less memory than both FEM and HMC.

## High Gradient Regions Analysis

For regions with high gradients (Î½=0.01), PINNs typically struggle to capture sharp transitions accurately without specialized techniques. This is because neural networks tend to learn smooth functions, and capturing discontinuities or near-discontinuities requires either very deep networks or adaptive sampling strategies.

## Conclusion

Physics-Informed Neural Networks provide a flexible approach for solving Burgers' equation. While they may not always match the accuracy of specialized numerical methods like FEM for problems with well-understood physics, they offer advantages in terms of:

1. Flexibility in handling complex geometries
2. No need for mesh generation
3. Potential for transfer learning across similar problems
4. Ability to incorporate sparse or noisy data

For the specific case of Burgers' equation with low viscosity (high Reynolds number), PINNs would benefit from adaptive sampling strategies that focus more training points in regions with sharp gradients.
